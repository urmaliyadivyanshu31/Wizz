# WIZZ

WIZZ is a Fully On-Chain SocialFi platform where users can build, share, and earn. Own your data, showcase your skills, create opportunities, and connect directly with peersâ€”all while earning for your content.

## How It's Made

WIZZ is built using Next.js for the frontend, making it fast and user-friendly. The smart contracts are developed using Remix IDE, fully optimized for secure and cost-efficient transactions on the Flow blockchain, which is known for its scalability and low fees.

We integrated the wagmi library for smooth blockchain interactions, and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) for easy-to-read addresses.

WIZZ also integrates IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and pinning services to ensure decentralized storage for content and data. This allows users to store and access data securely, without relying on centralized servers, enhancing privacy and data ownership.

For job listings, we used the Sign protocol to verify the poster's credibility with attestations, ensuring genuine job postings. This creates a decentralized, transparent, and efficient platform for users to build, share, and earn.
