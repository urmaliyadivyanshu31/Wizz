# WIZZ

WIZZ is a groundbreaking Fully On-Chain SocialFi platform designed to revolutionize how job seekers, creators, developers, institutions, and VCs interact in the digital economy. By integrating SocialFi (Social Finance) principles with decentralized infrastructure, WIZZ offers a seamless environment where individuals and organizations can Build, Share, and Earn—all while retaining full ownership and control over their data and content.

## Project Description

WIZZ is a Fully On-Chain SocialFi platform where users can build, share, and earn. Own your data, showcase your skills, create opportunities, and connect directly with peers—all while earning for your content.

### Key Features:

- **Fully On-Chain Credentials (Creds)**: WIZZ ensures that users can create and store immutable, verifiable records of their achievements, skills, and contributions. Whether you're a developer completing a project, a content creator posting valuable work, or a student gaining new skills, WIZZ records it all on-chain, offering a transparent and tamper-proof portfolio of your credentials that can be shared with potential employers or collaborators.

- **SocialFi Integration**: SocialFi enables users to earn rewards for engaging with the community—whether that's through creating content, collaborating with others, or participating in peer-to-peer exchanges. Unlike traditional social media platforms, where engagement benefits the platform, WIZZ empowers users to monetize their social interactions, making it a true "earn as you engage" ecosystem.

- **User-Centric Design**: WIZZ is built with a focus on user experience and engagement. The platform is easy to navigate and encourages interaction while offering tools that allow users to personalize their journey. The intuitive interface ensures that whether you're a seasoned developer or someone new to the blockchain space, you can find value in the platform.

- **Data Ownership**: Users on WIZZ are in full control of their data. Unlike centralized platforms where personal information is harvested and monetized without consent, WIZZ operates on a decentralized architecture, meaning that you own your data and decide who can access it. This model offers unprecedented privacy and freedom for users to manage their digital identity.

- **Earn for Your Content**: Content creators often struggle to monetize their work on traditional platforms due to high fees and platform restrictions. WIZZ changes that by offering multiple revenue streams, including peer-to-peer tipping, content subscriptions, and tokenized rewards for valuable contributions. Every piece of content is yours, and every interaction is rewarded, making it a sustainable ecosystem for creators.

- **Peer-to-Peer Connections**: WIZZ facilitates direct, decentralized peer-to-peer interactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries in collaboration and communication. Whether you're forming a team for a project, connecting with VCs for funding, or looking for new career opportunities, WIZZ's P2P connections ensure direct, transparent, and frictionless interactions.

- **Proof of Skill**: WIZZ's Proof of Skill mechanism allows users to showcase their abilities through on-chain verified contributions, project completions, and community recognition. These credentials are publicly viewable and verifiable, enabling users to build a provable portfolio of their talents that can be used for career advancement, collaboration opportunities, or financial backing.

- **Create Your Own Opportunity**: One of WIZZ's core philosophies is empowerment. Whether you're a job seeker, an entrepreneur, or a creative, WIZZ enables you to take control of your own career. Users can build and showcase projects, connect directly with like-minded professionals, and pitch ideas to investors—all in a decentralized, trustless environment. This creates a global marketplace of opportunities where traditional barriers to entry are broken down, offering a level playing field for all participants.

## Problem Solved:

In the traditional job market, job seekers face significant barriers such as limited career flexibility, middlemen-controlled compensation, and outdated credentialing systems. VCs struggle with transparency and liquidity in investments, while institutions face challenges in keeping curriculums relevant and engaging with skilled talent. WIZZ solves these problems by offering a decentralized platform that connects all stakeholders directly, promotes transparency, and incentivizes participation through earned rewards.

## Target Audience:

- **Developers**: Seeking control over their work and looking to earn for their contributions to projects.
- **Creators**: Looking to monetize their content without intermediaries and build their brand.
- **Students**: Gaining experience through verifiable on-chain credentials and networking with industry professionals.
- **Venture Capitalists**: Investing directly in innovative projects with real-time transparency and enhanced liquidity.
- **Institutions**: Seeking up-to-date tools and resources to educate and connect their students with the evolving job market.

WIZZ empowers everyone to Build, Share, and Earn in a decentralized, user-driven ecosystem where opportunities are limitless and barriers are non-existent.

## How It's Made

WIZZ is built using Next.js for the frontend, making it fast and user-friendly. The smart contracts are developed using Remix IDE, fully optimized for secure and cost-efficient transactions on the Flow blockchain, which is known for its scalability and low fees.

We integrated the wagmi library for smooth blockchain interactions, and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) for easy-to-read addresses.

WIZZ also integrates IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and pinning services to ensure decentralized storage for content and data. This allows users to store and access data securely, without relying on centralized servers, enhancing privacy and data ownership.

For job listings, we used the Sign protocol to verify the poster's credibility with attestations, ensuring genuine job postings. This creates a decentralized, transparent, and efficient platform for users to build, share, and earn.
